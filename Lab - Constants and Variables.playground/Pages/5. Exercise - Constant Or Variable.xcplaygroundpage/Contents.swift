## Exercise - Constant or Variable?
 
 Imagine you're creating a simple photo sharing app. You want to keep track of the following metrics for each post:
- Number of likes: the number of likes that a photo has received
- Number of comments: the number of comments other users have left on the photo
- Year created: The year the post was created
- Month created: The month the post was created represented by a number between 1 and 12
- Day created: The day of the month the post was created
 
 For each of the metrics above, declare either a constant or a variable and assign it a value corresponding to a hypothetical post. Be sure to use proper naming conventions.

var Likes: Int = 69
print("As the number of likes will vary over time, on this sharing app.")
var Comments: Int = 68
print("As the number of comments will also vary over time if other users wants to comment on the post.")
let YearCreated: Int = 2025
print("As the certain post was created on a certain year so it will not change over time.")
let MonthCreated: String = "May"
print("As the certain post was created on a certain month so it will not change over time.")
let DayCreated: Int = 4
